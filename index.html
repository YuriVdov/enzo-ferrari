                <h2>Short story about Enzo</h2>
                <p id="tribute-info">Enzo Ferrari spent a reserved life, and rarely granted interviews. He seldom left Modena and Maranello and never went to any Grands Prix outside of Italy after the 1950s. He was usually seen at the Grands Prix at Monza near Milan and Imola, not far from the Ferrari factory, and named after the late Dino. His last known trip abroad was in 1982 when he went to Paris to broker a compromise between the warring FISA and FOCA parties. He never flew in an aeroplane and never set foot in a lift.</p>
                <p>He married Laura Dominica Garello (c. 1900–1978) on 28 April 1923, and they remained married until her death. They had one son, Alfredo "Dino", who was born in 1932 and groomed as Enzo's successor, but he suffered from ill-health and died from muscular dystrophy in 1956. Enzo had a second son, Piero, with his mistress Lina Lardi in 1945. As divorce was illegal in Italy until 1975, Piero could only be recognized as Enzo's son after Laura's death in 1978. Piero is currently the vice chairman of the Ferrari company with a 10% share ownership.</p>
                <p>He was made a Cavaliere del Lavoro in 1952, to add to his honours of Cavaliere and Commendatore in the 1920s, Ferrari also received a number of honorary degrees, the Hammarskjöld Prize in 1962, the Columbus Prize in 1965, and the De Gasperi Award in 1987. In 1994, he was posthumously inducted into the International Motorsports Hall of Fame.</p>
                <p>He was inducted into the Automotive Hall of Fame in 2000.</p>
